We will show two different ways to use the `HighlightedText` component -- depending on your NER model, either of these two ways may be easier to learn! \n\n### Prerequisites\n\nMake sure you have the `gradio` Python package already [installed](/getting_started). You will also need a pretrained named-entity recognition model. You can use your own, while in this tutorial, we will use one from the `transformers` library.\n\n### Approach 1: List of Entity Dictionaries\n\nMany named-entity recognition models output a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary consists of an *entity*, a \"start\" index, and an \"end\" index. This is, for example, how NER models in the `transformers` library operate:\n\n```py\nfrom transformers import pipeline \nner_pipeline = pipeline(\"ner\")\nner_pipeline(\"Does Chicago have any Pakistani restaurants\")\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```bash\n[{'entity': 'I-LOC',\n  'score': 0.9988978,\n  'index': 2,\n  'word': 'Chicago',\n  'start': 5,\n  'end': 12},\n {'entity': 'I-MISC',\n  'score': 0.9958592,\n  'index': 5,\n  'word': 'Pakistani',\n  'start': 22,\n  'end': 31}]\n```\n\nIf you have such a model, it is very easy to hook it up to Gradio's `HighlightedText` component. All you need to do is pass in this **list of entities**, along with the **original text** to the model, together as dictionary, with the keys being `\"entities\"` and `\"text\"` respectively.\n\nHere is a complete example:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nimport gradio as gr\n\nner_pipeline = pipeline(\"ner\")\n\nexamples = [\n    \"Does Chicago have any stores and does Joe live here?\",\n]\n\ndef ner(text):\n    output = ner_pipeline(text)\n    return {\"text\": text, \"entities\": output}    \n\ndemo = gr.Interface(ner,\n             gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"Enter sentence here...\"), \n             gr.HighlightedText(),\n             examples=examples)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/ner_pipeline'></gradio-app>\n\n### Approach 2: List of Tuples\n\nAn alternative way to pass data into the `HighlightedText` component is a list of tuples. The first element of each tuple should be the word or words that are being classified into a particular entity. The second element should be the entity label (or `None` if they should be unlabeled). The `HighlightedText` component automatically strings together the words and labels to display the entities.\n\nIn some cases, this can be easier than the first approach. Here is a demo showing this approach using Spacy's parts-of-speech tagger:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport os\nos.system('python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm')\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\n\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\ndef text_analysis(text):\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    html = displacy.render(doc, style=\"dep\", page=True)\n    html = (\n        \"<div style='max-width:100%; max-height:360px; overflow:auto'>\"\n        + html\n        + \"</div>\"\n    )\n    pos_count = {\n        \"char_count\": len(text),\n        \"token_count\": 0,\n    }\n    pos_tokens = []\n\n    for token in doc:\n        pos_tokens.extend([(token.text, token.pos_), (\" \", None)])\n\n    return pos_tokens, pos_count, html\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    text_analysis,\n    gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"Enter sentence here...\"),\n    [\"highlight\", \"json\", \"html\"],\n    examples=[\n        [\"What a beautiful morning for a walk!\"],\n        [\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\"],\n    ],\n)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/text_analysis'></gradio-app>\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nAnd you're done! That's all you need to know to build a web-based GUI for your NER model. \n\nFun tip: you can share your NER demo instantly with others simply by setting `share=True` in `launch()`. \n\n\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"named-entity-recognition\">Named-Entity Recognition</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>Named-entity recognition (NER), also known as token classification or text tagging, is the task of taking a sentence and classifying every word (or \"token\") into different categories, such as names of people or names of locations, or different parts of speech. </p>\n\n<p>For example, given the sentence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Does Chicago have any Pakistani restaurants?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A named-entity recognition algorithm may  identify:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"Chicago\" as a <strong>location</strong></li>\n<li>\"Pakistani\" as an <strong>ethnicity</strong>  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and so on. </p>\n\n<p>Using <code>gradio</code> (specifically the <code>HighlightedText</code> component), you can easily build a web demo of your NER model and share that with the rest of your team.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of a demo that you'll be able to build:</p>\n\n<p><gradio-app space='gradio/ner_pipeline'></gradio-app></p>\n\n<p>This tutorial will show how to take a pretrained NER model and deploy it with a Gradio interface.
