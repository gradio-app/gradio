class WebhooksServer:
    """
    The [`WebhooksServer`] class lets you create an instance of a Gradio app that can receive Huggingface webhooks.
    These webhooks can be registered using the [`~WebhooksServer.add_webhook`] decorator. Webhook endpoints are added to
    the app as a POST endpoint to the FastAPI router. Once all the webhooks are registered, the `launch` method has to be
    called to start the app.

    It is recommended to accept [`WebhookPayload`] as the first argument of the webhook function. It is a Pydantic
    model that contains all the information about the webhook event. The data will be parsed automatically for you.

    Check out the [webhooks guide](../guides/webhooks_server) for a step-by-step tutorial on how to setup your
    WebhooksServer and deploy it on a Space.

    <Tip warning={true}>

    `WebhooksServer` is experimental. Its API is subject to change in the future.

    </Tip>

    <Tip warning={true}>

    You must have `gradio` installed to use `WebhooksServer` (`pip install --upgrade gradio`).

    </Tip>

    Args:
        ui (`gradio.Blocks`, optional):
            A Gradio UI instance to be used as the Space landing page. If `None`, a UI displaying instructions
            about the configured webhooks is created.
        webhook_secret (`str`, optional):
            A secret key to verify incoming webhook requests. You can set this value to any secret you want as long as
            you also configure it in your [webhooks settings panel](https://huggingface.co/settings/webhooks). You
            can also set this value as the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable. If no secret is provided, the
            webhook endpoints are opened without any security.

    Example:

        ```python
        import gradio as gr

    """Decorator to start a [`WebhooksServer`] and register the decorated function as a webhook endpoint.

    This is a helper to get started quickly. If you need more flexibility (custom landing page or webhook secret),
    you can use [`WebhooksServer`] directly. You can register multiple webhook endpoints (to the same server) by using
    this decorator multiple times.

    Check out the [webhooks guide](../guides/webhooks_server) for a step-by-step tutorial on how to setup your

    Args:
        path (`str`, optional):
            The URL path to register the webhook function. If not provided, the function name will be used as the path.
            In any case, all webhooks are registered under `/webhooks`.

    Examples:
        The default usage is to register a function as a webhook endpoint. The function name will be used as the path.
        The server will be started automatically at exit (i.e. at the end of the script).

        ```python
        from huggingface_hub import webhook_endpoint, WebhookPayload

        @webhook_endpoint

                ...

        # Server is automatically started at the end of the script.

    This is a hacky way to add the `request` parameter to the function signature. Since FastAPI based itself on route

    object (and hence the headers). A far cleaner solution would be to use a middleware. However, since
    `fastapi==0.90.1`, a middleware cannot be added once the app has started. And since the FastAPI app is started by
    Gradio internals (and not by us), we cannot add a middleware.

    This method is called only when a secret has been defined by the user. If a request is sent without the
    "x-webhook-secret", the function will return a 401 error (unauthorized). If the header is sent but is incorrect,
    the function will return a 403 error (forbidden).
