            If the LFS batch endpoint returned an HTTP error.

    **How it works:**
        The file download system uses Xet storage, which is a content-addressable storage system that breaks files into chunks
            for efficient storage and transfer.

        `hf_xet.upload_files` manages uploading files by:
            - Taking a list of file paths to upload
            - Breaking files into smaller chunks for efficient storage
            - Avoiding duplicate storage by recognizing identical chunks across files
            - Connecting to a storage server (CAS server) that manages these chunks

        The upload process works like this:
        1. Create a local folder at ~/.cache/huggingface/xet/chunk-cache to store file chunks for reuse.
        2. Process files in parallel (up to 8 files at once):
            2.1. Read the file content.
            2.2. Split the file content into smaller chunks based on content patterns: each chunk gets a unique ID based on what's in it.
            2.3. For each chunk:
                - Check if it already exists in storage.
                - Skip uploading chunks that already exist.
            2.4. Group chunks into larger blocks for efficient transfer.
            2.5. Upload these blocks to the storage server.
            2.6. Create and upload information about how the file is structured.
        3. Return reference files that contain information about the uploaded files, which can be used later to download them.
