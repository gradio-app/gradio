## 1.3.1

### Fixes

- [#5324](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5324) [`31996c99`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/31996c991d6bfca8cef975eb8e3c9f61a7aced19) - ensure login form has correct styles. Thanks [@pngwn](https://github.com/pngwn)!

## 1.3.0

### Highlights

#### Improve startup performance and markdown support ([#5279](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5279) [`fe057300`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/fe057300f0672c62dab9d9b4501054ac5d45a4ec))

##### Improved markdown support

We now have better support for markdown in `gr.Markdown` and `gr.Dataframe`. Including syntax highlighting and Github Flavoured Markdown. We also have more consistent markdown behaviour and styling.

##### Various performance improvements

These improvements will be particularly beneficial to large applications.

- Rather than attaching events manually, they are now delegated, leading to a significant performance improvement and addressing a performance regression introduced in a recent version of Gradio. App startup for large applications is now around twice as fast.
- Optimised the mounting of individual components, leading to a modest performance improvement during startup (~30%).
- Corrected an issue that was causing markdown to re-render infinitely.
- Ensured that the `gr.3DModel` does re-render prematurely.

Thanks [@pngwn](https://github.com/pngwn)!

#### Add `render` function to `<gradio-app>` ([#5158](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5158) [`804fcc05`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/804fcc058e147f283ece67f1f353874e26235535))

We now have an event `render` on the <gradio-app> web component, which is triggered once the embedded space has finished rendering.

```html
<script>
  function handleLoadComplete() {
    console.log("Embedded space has finished rendering");
  }
  const gradioApp = document.querySelector("gradio-app");
  gradioApp.addEventListener("render", handleLoadComplete);
</script>
```

## 1.2.0

### Highlights

#### Client.predict will now return the final output for streaming endpoints ([#5057](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5057) [`35856f8b`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/35856f8b54548cae7bd3b8d6a4de69e1748283b2))

### This is a breaking change (for gradio_client only)!

Previously, `Client.predict` would only return the first output of an endpoint that streamed results. This was causing confusion for developers that wanted to call these streaming demos via the client.

We realize that developers using the client don't know the internals of whether a demo streams or not, so we're changing the behavior of predict to match developer expectations.

Using `Client.predict` will now return the final output of a streaming endpoint. This will make it even easier to use gradio apps via the client.
