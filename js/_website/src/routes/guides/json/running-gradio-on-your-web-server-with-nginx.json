Gradio apps can be deployed on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://hf.space) for free. \n\nIn some cases though, you might want to deploy a Gradio app on your own web server. You might already be using [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), a highly performant web server, to serve your website (say `https://www.example.com`), and you want to attach Gradio to a specific subpath on your website (e.g. `https://www.example.com/gradio-demo`). \n\nIn this Guide, we will guide you through the process of running a Gradio app behind Nginx on your own web server to achieve this.\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n1. A Linux web server with [Nginx installed](https://www.nginx.com/blog/setting-up-nginx/) and [Gradio installed](/quickstart)  \n    \n2. A working Gradio app saved as a python file on your web server\n\n## Editing your Nginx configuration file\n\n1. Start by editing the Nginx configuration file on your web server. By default, this is located at: `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`\n\nIn the `http` block, add the following line to include server block configurations from a separate file:\n\n```bash\ninclude /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;\n```\n\n2. Create a new file in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available` directory (create the directory if it does not already exist), using a filename that represents your app, for example: `sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_gradio_app`\n\n3. Paste the following into your file editor:\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name example.com www.example.com;  # Change this to your domain name \n\n    location /gradio-demo/ {  # Change this if you'd like to server your Gradio app on a different path\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7860/; # Change this if your Gradio app will be running on a different port\n        proxy_redirect off;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Run your Gradio app on your web server\n\n1. Before you launch your Gradio app, you'll need to set the `root_path` to be the same as the subpath that you specified in your nginx configuration. This is necessary for Gradio to run on any subpath besides the root of the domain.\n\nHere's a simple example of a Gradio app with a custom `root_path`:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport time\n\ndef test(x):\ntime.sleep(4)\nreturn x\n\ngr.Interface(test, \"textbox\", \"textbox\").queue().launch(root_path=\"/gradio-demo\")\n```\n\n2. Start a `tmux` session by typing `tmux` and pressing enter (optional) \n\nIt's recommended that you run your Gradio app in a `tmux` session so that you can keep it running in the background easily\n\n3. Then, start your Gradio app. Simply type in `python` followed by the name of your Gradio python file. By default, your app will run on `localhost:7860`, but if it starts on a different port, you will need to update the nginx configuration file above.\n\n## Restart Nginx\n\n1. If you are in a tmux session, exit by typing CTRL+B (or CMD+B), followed by the \"D\" key.\n\n2. Finally, restart nginx by running `sudo systemctl restart nginx`. \n\nAnd that's it! If you visit `https://example.com/gradio-demo` on your browser, you should see your Gradio app running there\n\n", "tags": ["DEPLOYMENT", "WEB SERVER", "NGINX"], "spaces": [], "url": "/guides/running-gradio-on-your-web-server-with-nginx/", "contributor": null}}
