# Introduction

### Gradio Clients
## Gradio applications support programmatic requests from many environments:

- The [Python Client](/docs/python-client): `gradio-client` allows you to make requests from Python environments. 
- The [JavaScript Client](/docs/js-client): `@gradio/client` allows you to make requests in TypeScript from the browser or server-side.
- You can also query gradio apps [directly from cURL](/guides/querying-gradio-apps-with-curl). 

### Community Clients
## We also encourage the development and use of third party clients built by the community: 

- [Rust Client](/docs/third-party-clients/rust-client): `gradio-rs` built by [@JacobLinCool](https://github.com/JacobLinCool) allows you to make requests in Rust. 
- [Powershell Client](https://github.com/rrg92/powershai): `powershai` built by [@rrg92](https://github.com/rrg92) allows you to make requests to Gradio apps directly from Powershell. See [here for documentation](https://github.com/rrg92/powershai/blob/main/docs/en-US/providers/HUGGING-FACE.md)
