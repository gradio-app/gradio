      <h1>Sharing</h1>
      <p>Gradio comes with built in support for sharing models. When gradio
      launches an interface for a model, it also creates a shareable link that
      can be sent out by the creator to collaborators so they can access the
      interface from their browsers. The link does not require these remote
      users to have gradio, Python, or any environment set up.</p>
      <p>This link, which is printed to the console, is generated by adding
      the parameter <code><span class="var">share</span>=True</code> when
      launching the interface: e.g. <code>io.<span
      class="func">launch(</span><span class="var">share</span>=True<span
      class="func">)</span></code>. The link stays active for 8 hours.
      Other users can access the gradio interface from the link remotely, but
      the model stays on the original host computer. When remote users submit
      inputs to the gradio interface, the browser makes a call to the host
      computer with the input provided. On the host, the model will generate
      the output based on the provided input, and return the output, which
      will be rendered in the remote browser’s output pane. </p>
      <p>Because these remote interfaces will run models on the host machine
      and draw from its compute power, we do not recommend publicly share the
      generated links. Distribute them among trusted colleagues only.</p>

        When the remote user submits an input from their interface, the model
        executes on the host computer.

      <h1>Public Hosting</h1>
      <p>The option for permanent public hosting on gradio servers is coming
      soon! You will be able share your model publicly and collect user input
      data in this upcoming feature.</p>
