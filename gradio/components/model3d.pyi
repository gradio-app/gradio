        Parameters:
            value: path to (.obj, glb, or .gltf) file to show in model3D viewer. If callable, the function will be called whenever the app loads to set the initial value of the component.
            clear_color: background color of scene, should be a tuple of 4 floats between 0 and 1 representing RGBA values.
            camera_position: initial camera position of scene, provided as a tuple of `(alpha, beta, radius)`. Each value is optional. If provided, `alpha` and `beta` should be in degrees reflecting the angular position along the longitudinal and latitudinal axes, respectively. Radius corresponds to the distance from the center of the object to the camera.
            zoom_speed: the speed of zooming in and out of the scene when the cursor wheel is rotated or when screen is pinched on a mobile device. Should be a positive float, increase this value to make zooming faster, decrease to make it slower. Affects the wheelPrecision property of the camera.
            height: height of the model3D component, in pixels.
            label: component name in interface.
            show_label: if True, will display label.
            every: If `value` is a callable, run the function 'every' number of seconds while the client connection is open. Has no effect otherwise. Queue must be enabled. The event can be accessed (e.g. to cancel it) via this component's .load_event attribute.
            container: If True, will place the component in a container - providing some extra padding around the border.
            scale: relative width compared to adjacent Components in a Row. For example, if Component A has scale=2, and Component B has scale=1, A will be twice as wide as B. Should be an integer.
            min_width: minimum pixel width, will wrap if not sufficient screen space to satisfy this value. If a certain scale value results in this Component being narrower than min_width, the min_width parameter will be respected first.
            visible: If False, component will be hidden.
            elem_id: An optional string that is assigned as the id of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            elem_classes: An optional list of strings that are assigned as the classes of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.

            api_name: Defines how the endpoint appears in the API docs. Can be a string, None, or False. If False, the endpoint will not be exposed in the api docs. If set to None, the endpoint will be exposed in the api docs as an unnamed endpoint, although this behavior will be changed in Gradio 4.0. If set to a string, the endpoint will be exposed in the api docs with the given name.
            status_tracker: Deprecated and has no effect.

            batch: If True, then the function should process a batch of inputs, meaning that it should accept a list of input values for each parameter. The lists should be of equal length (and be up to length `max_batch_size`). The function is then *required* to return a tuple of lists (even if there is only 1 output component), with each list in the tuple corresponding to one output component.
            max_batch_size: Maximum number of inputs to batch together if this is called from the queue (only relevant if batch=True)

            postprocess: If False, will not run postprocessing of component data before returning 'fn' output to the browser.
            cancels: A list of other events to cancel when this listener is triggered. For example, setting cancels=[click_event] will cancel the click_event, where click_event is the return value of another components .click method. Functions that have not yet run (or generators that are iterating) will be cancelled, but functions that are currently running will be allowed to finish.
