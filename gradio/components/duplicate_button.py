        Parameters:
        Parameters:
            value: default text for the button to display. If a function is provided, the function will be called each time the app loads to set the initial value of this component.
            every: continuously calls `value` to recalculate it if `value` is a function (has no effect otherwise). Can provide a Timer whose tick resets `value`, or a float that provides the regular interval for the reset Timer.
            inputs: components that are used as inputs to calculate `value` if `value` is a function (has no effect otherwise). `value` is recalculated any time the inputs change.
            variant: sets the background and text color of the button. Use 'primary' for main call-to-action buttons, 'secondary' for a more subdued style, 'stop' for a stop button, 'huggingface' for a black background with white text, consistent with Hugging Face's button styles.
            size: size of the button. Can be "sm", "md", or "lg".
            icon: URL or path to the icon file to display within the button. If None, no icon will be displayed.
            link: URL to open when the button is clicked. If None, no link will be used.
            visible: if False, component will be hidden.
            interactive: if False, the Button will be in a disabled state.
            elem_id: an optional string that is assigned as the id of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            elem_classes: an optional list of strings that are assigned as the classes of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            render: if False, component will not render be rendered in the Blocks context. Should be used if the intention is to assign event listeners now but render the component later.
            key: if assigned, will be used to assume identity across a re-render. Components that have the same key across a re-render will have their value preserved.
            scale: relative size compared to adjacent Components. For example if Components A and B are in a Row, and A has scale=2, and B has scale=1, A will be twice as wide as B. Should be an integer. scale applies in Rows, and to top-level Components in Blocks where fill_height=True.
            min_width: minimum pixel width, will wrap if not sufficient screen space to satisfy this value. If a certain scale value results in this Component being narrower than min_width, the min_width parameter will be respected first.
