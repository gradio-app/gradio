# A note about the CHANGELOG

Hello 👋 and thank you for contributing to Gradio!

All pull requests must update the change log located in website/releases/UPCOMING.md unless they are labeled with the no-changelog-update label.

Please add a brief summary of the change to the Full Changelog section of the UPCOMING.md file and include
a link to the PR (formatted in markdown) and a link to your github profile (if you like). For example, "* Added a cool new feature by `[@myusername](link-to-your-github-profile)` in `[PR 11111](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/11111)`".

If you would like to elaborate on your change further, feel free to include a longer explanation in the other sections.
If you would like an image/gif/video showcasing your feature, it may be best to edit the CHANGELOG file using the 
GitHub web UI since that lets you upload files directly via drag-and-drop.
