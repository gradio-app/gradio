## AI Disclosure

We encourage the use of AI tooling in creating PRs, but the any non-trivial use of AI needs be disclosed. E.g. if you used Claude to write a first draft, you should mention that. Trivial tab-completion doesn't need to be disclosed. You should self-review all PRs, especially if they were generated with AI.
