# A note about the CHANGELOG

Hello 👋 and thank you for contributing to Gradio!

All pull requests must update the change log located in website/releases/UPCOMING.md unless they are labeled with the no-changelog-update label.

Please add a brief summary of the change to the Full Changelog section of the UPCOMING.md file and include the pr number.
For example, "* Added a cool new feature :pr:123". 

If you would like to elaborate on your change further, feel free to include a longer explanation in the other sections.
If you would like an image/gif/video showcasing your feature, it may be best to edit the CHANGELOG file using the 
GitHub web UI since that lets you upload files directly via drag-and-drop.
