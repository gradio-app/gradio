### 1. Auto Release Notes 🤖

We've created a new system for automatically tracking the changes that go into new releases. On every pull request commit,
a github action will check whether the `website/CHANGELOG.md` file has been updated with a line containing a brief summary
of the change and its associated pull request number. This check can be skipped if the `no-changelog-update` label is added
to the PR. The `CHANGELOG.md` file is then converted and displayed on our website!
